Specific areas of JavaScript and CSS you can study:
### **JavaScript:**
1. **DOM Manipulation:**
   - Learn how to interact with HTML elements (like images, divs, etc.) using `document.getElementById()`, `document.querySelector()`, and other DOM methods.
   - Explore event handling (`mousedown`, `mousemove`, `mouseup`, etc.) and how to dynamically manipulate styles and classes.
   
2. **Event Listeners and Handlers:**
   - Study how events work in JavaScript, especially the different types of mouse events (e.g., `mousedown`, `mouseup`, `mousemove`, `mouseleave`), and how to use them for interaction.

3. **Working with `dataset`:**
   - Study the `data-*` attributes in HTML and how JavaScript can interact with them through `dataset` to store and access data specific to an element.

4. **CSS Transitions and Animations:**
   - Learn how to trigger smooth animations using JavaScript (e.g., transitioning between CSS states, `transform` property for animations).
   
5. **Understanding `requestAnimationFrame`:**
   - This is helpful for smooth animation in JavaScript, especially for drag-and-drop effects and continuous transitions. It helps optimize performance.

### **CSS:**
1. **CSS Flexbox:**
   - Since we used Flexbox for centering and aligning the image slider, studying Flexbox properties (`justify-content`, `align-items`, `gap`, etc.) will deepen your understanding.

2. **CSS Positioning:**
   - Learn how to use `position: relative`, `position: absolute`, and `position: fixed` effectively for layout management. This helps control the position of elements like images and containers.

3. **CSS Transitions:**
   - We used transitions to smooth out changes when the images slide. Study how `transition` works (e.g., `transition: all 0.2s ease`) and how to apply it to CSS properties like `transform`, `opacity`, etc.

4. **CSS Pseudo-classes:**
   - You can explore `:hover`, `:active`, and `:focus` to handle user interactions and learn how to create effects based on element states.

5. **CSS Object-Fit & Object-Position:**
   - Learn how `object-fit: cover` and `object-position: center` work to control how images are scaled and positioned within their containers.

### **Additional Resources:**
- **MDN Web Docs**: A great place to learn about DOM events, JavaScript methods, and CSS properties.
- **JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures**: Once you're comfortable with the basics, you can delve deeper into algorithms and more complex JavaScript techniques.
